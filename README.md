This is the first game I made with a good friend I met at our university, UTN in 2017.
We shared code and made our own separated games within the executable, I developed HARD, a 2D cyberpunk arcade survival airshotting game.
My friend did BRUT, a gritty 2D arcade survival beat 'em up.
The name comes from the greek word dikhotomia, a dichotomy, something split in two parts.

How to play: Unzip the project to your desired location and run DikhotomiaSDL.exe, select the game you want by clicking on it or using arrow keys + enter.
Controls: 
  * BRUT: arrow keys for movement, A for dash, S for kick, D for throw. Kick an enemy then throw them into another to deal damage and eliminate them. Big enemies cannot be kicked.
  * HARD: WASD or arrow keys for movement, spacebar or up arrow to jump. Use mouse to aim and click to shoot the rocket launcher. Shoot the ground near enemies to make them fly into the air and shoot them again mid air to eliminate them, you can only damage enemies mid air.
  * For both games, medkits replenish 1 health point, current health is shown on the hud where it says "Salud"
